#The two roots of a quadratic equation, for example, ax^2 + bx + c = 0, can be obtained using the following formula:
#r1 = -1 * b + sqrt(b^2 - 4 * a * c) / 2 * a
#r2 = -1 * b - sqrt(b^2 - 4 * a * c) / 2 * a
#b^2 - 4 * a * c is called the discriminant of the quadratic equation. If it is positive, the equation has two real roots. 
#If it is zero, the equation has one root. If it is negative, the equation has no real roots. 
#Write a program that prompts the user to enter values for a, b, and c and displays the result based on the discriminant. 
#If the discriminant is positive, display two roots.
#If the discriminant is 0, display one root. Otherwise, display "The equation has no real roots".
