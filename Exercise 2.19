#Write a program that reads in an investment amount, the annual interest rate, and the number of years, and then displays the future investment value using the following formula:
#futureInvestmentValue = investmentAmount * (1 + monthlyInterestRate) ^ numberOfMonths
#For example, if you enter the amount 1000, an annual interest rate of 4.25%, and the number of years as 1, the future investment is 1043.33

investmentAmount = float(input("Enter the investment amount, for example 120000.95: "))
annualInterestRate = float(input("Enter annual interest rate, for example 8.25: "))
numberOfYears = int(input("Enter number of years as an integer, for example 5: "))

numberOfMonths = numberOfYears * 12
monthlyInterestRate = (annualInterestRate / 100) / 12

futureInvestmentValue = investmentAmount * ((1 + monthlyInterestRate) ** numberOfMonths)

print("Future value is", int(futureInvestmentValue * 100) / 100)
