#(Find the number of years and days) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the minutes (e.g., 1 billion) and displays the number of years and days for the minutes. 
#For simplicity, assume a year has 365 days.

minutes = int(input("Enter the number of minutes: "))

years = minutes // 525600
timeLeft = minutes % 525600

days = timeLeft // 1440


print(minutes, "minutes is approximately", years, "years and", days, "days")
