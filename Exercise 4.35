#(Slope-intercept form) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the coordinates of two points (x1, y1) andÂ (x2, y2) and displays the line equation in the slope-intercept form, i.e., y = mx + b .
#m and b can be computed using the following formula:
#m = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)    b=y1-mx1
#don't display m if it is 1 and don't display b if it is 0.

x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate for Point 1: "))
y1 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate for Point 1: "))
x2 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate for Point 2: "))
y2 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate for Point 2: "))

m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
b = y1 - (m * x1)

point1 = (x1, y1)
point2 = (x2, y2)

print("The line equationfor two points", point1, "and", point2, "is")

if m == 1:
    print("y = x +", b)
elif b == 0:
    print("y =", str(m) + "x")
elif b > 0:
    print("y =", str(m) + "x +", b)
else:   
    print("y =", str(m) + "x", b)
