#(Conversion from kilograms to pounds) Write a program that displays the following two tables side by side (note that 1 kilogram is 2.2 pounds):

print("Kilograms    Pounds  |   Pounds      Kilograms")

kilo = 1
lbs = 0
kilograms = 0
pounds = 20

while kilo <= 199 and pounds <= 515:
    lbs = kilo * 2.2
    kilograms = pounds * 0.454
    print(kilo, "       ", round(lbs, 1), "   |   ", pounds, "        ", round(kilograms, 2))
    kilo += 2
    pounds += 5
