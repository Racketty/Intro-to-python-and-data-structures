#Suppose a right triangle is placed in a plane as shown below. 
#The right-angle point is at (0, 0), and the other two points are at (200, 0), and (0, 100). 
#Write a program that prompts the user to enter a point with x- and y-coordinates and determines whether the point is inside the triangle.

x = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the point: "))
y = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the point: "))

elif x <= 150 and y <= 25.5:
    print("The point is in the triangle")
else:
    print("The point is not in the triangle")
