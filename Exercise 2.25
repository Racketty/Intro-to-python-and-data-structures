#Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and 1000 and adds all the digits in the integer. 
#For example, if an integer is 932, the sum of all its digits is 14. 
#(Hint: Use the % operator to extract digits, and use the // operator to remove the extracted digit. 
#For instance, 932 % 10 = 2 and 932 // 10 = 93.)Â 

integer = int(input("Enter an integer between 0 and 1000: "))

third = integer % 10
second = (integer // 10) % 10
first = (integer // 100) % 10

sum = first + second + third

print("The sum of all digits in", integer, "is", sum)
