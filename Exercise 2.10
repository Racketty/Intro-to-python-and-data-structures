#Given an airplane’s acceleration a and take-off speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to take off using the following formula:​
#length = v^2 / 2a
#Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s), the acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s^2), and then displays the minimum runway length.

v = float(input("Enter speed: "))
a = float(input("Enter acceleration: "))

length = (v ** 2) / (2 * a)

print("The minimum runway length for this airplane is", length, "meters")
