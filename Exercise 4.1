#Write a program that prompts the user to enter the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex 
#and computes the area of the pentagon, as shown in the following figure.
#The formula for computing the area of a pentagon is area = (5 * s^2) / (4 * tan(pi/5))
#where s is the length of a side, The side can be computed using the formula s = 2 * r * sin(pi/5), 
#where r is the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex. 
#Round up two digits after the decimal point

import math

r = float(input("Enter the length from the center to a vertex: "))

s = 2 * r * math.sin(math.pi / 5)

area = (5 * pow(s, 2)) / (4 * math.tan(math.pi / 5))

print("The area of the pentagon is ", round(area, 2))
