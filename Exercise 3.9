#Suppose you shop for rice and find it in two different-sized packages. You would like to write a program to compare the cost of the packages. 
#The program prompts the user to enter the weight and price of each package and then displays the one with the better price.

weight1 = float(input("Enter weight for package 1: "))
price1 = float(input("Enter price for package 1: "))
weight2 = float(input("Enter weight for package 2: "))
price2 = float(input("Enter price for package 2: "))

average1 = price1 / weight1
average2 = price2 / weight2

if average1 > average2:
    print("Package 2 has the best price.")
else:
    print("Package 1 has the best price.")
