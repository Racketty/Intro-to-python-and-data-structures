#(Geometry: area of a regular polygon) 
#A regular polygon is an n-sided polygon in which all sides are of the same length and all angles have the same degree (i.e., the polygon is both equilateral and equiangular). 
#The formula for computing the area of a regular polygon is 
# area = (n * s^2) / (4 * tan(pi/n))
#Here, s is the length of a side. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of sides and their length of a regular polygon and displays its area.

import math

sides = int(input("Enter the number of sides: "))
sideLength = float(input("Enter the length of the side: "))

area = (sides * sideLength ** 2) / (4 * math.tan(math.pi / sides))

print("The area of the polygon is", area)
