#Suppose you save $100 each month into a savings account with an annual interest rate of 5%. 
#Therefore, the monthly interest rate is 0.05 / 12 = 0.00417.Â After the first month, the value in the account becomes
#100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
#After the second month, the value in the account becomes
#(100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252
#After the third month, the value in the account becomes
#(100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507
#and so on
#Write a program that prompts the user to enter a monthly saving amount and displays the account value after the sixth month.
#Keep two digits after the decimal point.
