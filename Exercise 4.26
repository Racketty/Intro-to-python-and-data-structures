#(Student major and status) Write a program that prompts the user to enter two characters and displays the major and status represented in the characters. 
#The first character indicates the major and the second is number character 1, 2, 3, and 4, which indicates whether a student is a freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior. 
#Suppose the following characters are used to denote the majors:
#M: Mathematics
#C: Computer Science
#I: Information Technology

student = input("Enter two characters: ")

if student[0] == ("M"):
    major = "Mathematics"
elif student[0] == ("C"):
    major = "Computer Science"
elif student[0] == ("I"):
    major = "Information Technology"
else:
    exit()

if student[1] == ("1"):
    status = "Freshman"
elif student[1] == ("2"):
    status = "Sophomore"
elif student[1] == ("3"):
    status = "Junior"
elif student[1] == ("4"):
    status = "Senior"
else:
    exit()

print(major)
print(status)
