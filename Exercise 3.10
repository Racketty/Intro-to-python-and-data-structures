#LiveExample 3.3, SubtractionQuiz.py, randomly generates a subtraction question. 
#Revise the program to randomly generate a multiplication question with two integers less than 100.

import random

# 1. Generate two random single-digit integers
number1 = random.randint(0, 99)
number2 = random.randint(0, 99)

# 2. If number1 < number2, swap number1 with number2
if number1 < number2:
    number1, number2 = number2, number1 # Simultaneous assignment

# 4. Prompt the student to answer "what is number1 * number2?"
answer = int(input("What is " + str(number1) + " * " + 
    str(number2) + "? "))

# 4. Grade the answer and display the result
if number1 * number2 == answer:
    print("You are correct!")
else:
    print("Your answer is wrong.")
    print(number1, '*', number2, "is", number1 * number2)
