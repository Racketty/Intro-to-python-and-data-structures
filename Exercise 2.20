#If you know the balance and the annual percentage interest rate, you can compute the interest on the next monthly payment using the following formula:
#interest = balance * (annualInterestRate / 1200)
#Write a program that reads the balance and the annual percentage interest rate and then displays the interest for the next month.
#Keep two digits after the decimal point.

balance = float(input("Enter balance: "))
annualInterestRate = float(input("Enter annual interest rate: "))

interest = balance * (annualInterestRate / 1200)

print("The interest is", int(interest * 100) / 100)
