#(Geometry: area of a hexagon) The area of a hexagon can be computed using the following formula ( is the length of a side):
# area = (6 * s^2) / (4 * tan(pi/6))
#Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays its area.

import math

side = float(input(("Enter the side: ")))

area = (6 * side ** 2) / (4 * math.tan(math.pi / 6))

print("The area of the hexagon is", area)
