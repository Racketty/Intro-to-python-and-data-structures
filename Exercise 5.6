#(Conversion from miles to kilometers and kilometers to miles) Write a program that displays the following two tables side by side (note that 1 mile is 1.609 kilometers):

print("Miles    Kilometers  |   Kilometers      Miles")

miles = 1
kilo = 0
kilometers = 0
mi = 20

while miles <= 10 and mi <= 65:
    kilo = miles * 1.609
    kilometers = mi * 0.62137
    print(miles, "       ", round(kilo, 3), "   |   ", mi, "        ", round(kilometers, 3))
    miles += 1
    mi += 5
