#Average acceleration is defined as the change of velocity divided by the time taken to make the change, as shown in the following formula:
#a = v1 - v0 / t
#Write a program that prompts the user to enter the starting velocity v0 in meters/second, the ending velocity v1 in meters/second,
#the time span t in seconds, and then displays the average acceleration.

v0 = float(input("Enter v0: "))
v1 = float(input("Enter v1: "))
t = float(input("Enter t: "))

a = (v1 - v0) / t

print("The average acceleration is", a)
