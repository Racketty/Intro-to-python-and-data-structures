#LiveExample 2.7, ShowCurrentTime.py, gives a program that displays the current time in GMT. 
#Revise the program so that it prompts the user to enter the time zone in hours away from (offset to) GMT and displays the time in the specified time zone.

import time

offset = int(input("Enter the time zone offset to GMT: "))

currentTime = time.time() # Get current time

# Obtain the total seconds since midnight, Jan 1, 1970
totalSeconds = int(currentTime)

# Get the current second 
currentSecond = totalSeconds % 60 

# Obtain the total minutes
totalMinutes = totalSeconds // 60 

# Compute the current minute in the hour
currentMinute = totalMinutes % 60

# Obtain the total hours
totalHours = totalMinutes // 60

# Compute the current hour
currentHour = (totalHours + offset) % 24

# Display results
print("Current time is", currentHour, ":", 
    currentMinute, ":", currentSecond, "GMT")
