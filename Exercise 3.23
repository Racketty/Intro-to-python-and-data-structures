#Write a program that prompts the user to enter a point (x, y) and checks whether the point is within the rectangle centered at (0, 0) with width 10 and height 5. 
#For example, (2, 2) is inside the rectangle and (6, 4) is outside the rectangle, as shown in Figure 3.8b. 
#(Hint: A point is in the rectangle if its horizontal distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal to 10/2 and its vertical distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal to 5.0/2. 
#Test your program to cover all cases.)

x1 = float(input("Enter the x-coordinate of the point: "))
y1 = float(input("Enter the y-coordinate of the point: "))

x2 = 0.0
y2 = 0.0

if x1 <= (10 / 2) and x1 >= -5 and y1 <= (5.0 / 2) and y2 >= -2.5:
    print("Point (" + str(x1) + ", " + str(y1) + ") is in the rectangle")
else:
    print("Point (" + str(x1) + ", " + str(y1) + ") is not in the rectangle")
