#Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays its area. 
#The formula for computing the area of a hexagon is
#area = (3 * sqrt(3) / 2) * s^2
#where s is the length of a side

s = float(input("Enter the side: "))

area = (3 * (3 ** 0.5) / 2) * (s ** 2)

print("The area of the hexagon is", area)
