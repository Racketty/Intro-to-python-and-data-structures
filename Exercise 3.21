#Zellerâ€™s congruence is an algorithm developed by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week. The formula is
#h = (q + [(26 * (m + 1)) / 10] + k + [k / 4] + [j / 4] + 5 * j) % 7
#where h is the day of the week (0: Saturday, 1: Sunday, 2: Monday, 3: Tuesday, 4: Wednesday, 5: Thursday, 6: Friday)
#q is the day of the month
#m is the month (3: March, 4: April, ..., 12: December). January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year.
#j is [year / 100].
#k is the year of the century (i.e., year % 100)
#Write a program that prompts the user to enter year, month, and day of the month, and then it displays the name of the day of the week.
