#Conversion from miles to kilometers) Write a program that displays the following table (note that 1 mile is 1.609 kilometers):
#Miles      Kilometers
#1          1.609
#2          3.218
#...
#9          14.481
#10         16.090

print("Miles        Kilometers")

miles = 0

while miles < 10:
    miles += 1
    kilo = miles * 1.609
    print(miles, "          ", round(kilo, 3))
