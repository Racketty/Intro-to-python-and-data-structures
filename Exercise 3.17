#Write a program that plays the popular scissor-rock-paper game. 
#(A scissor can cut a paper, a rock can knock a scissor, and a paper can wrap a rock.) 
#The program randomly generates a number 0, 1, or 2 representing scissor, rock, and paper. 
#The program prompts the user to enter a number 0, 1, or 2 and displays a message indicating whether the user or the computer wins, loses, or draws.

import random

computer = random.randint(0, 2)

choice = int(input("scissor (0), rock (1), paper (2): "))

if choice == computer:
    print("Draw!")
elif choice == 1 and computer == 0:
    print("You Win!")
elif choice == 2 and computer == 1:
    print("You Win!")
elif choice == 0 and computer == 2:
    print("You Win!")
elif choice == 0 and computer == 1:
    print("Computer Wins!")
elif choice == 1 and computer == 2:
    print("Computer Wins!")
