#Write a program that prompts the user to enter the coordinates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and displays the slope of the line connects the two points. 
#The formula of the slope is (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

x1 = float(input("Enter x coordinate of Point 1: "))
y1 = float(input("Enter y coordinate of Point 1: "))
x2 = float(input("Enter x coordinate of Point 2: "))
y2 = float(input("Enter y coordinate of Point 2: "))

slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

print("The slope that connects the two points is", slope)
