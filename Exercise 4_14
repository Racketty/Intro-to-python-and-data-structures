#(Random point on a circle) Write a program that generates three random points on a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 40 and display three angles in a triangle formed by these three points, as shown in Figure 4.11a. 
#(Hint: Generate a random angle α in radians between 0 and 2π , as shown in Figure 4.11b and the point determined by this angle is (r*cos(a), r*sin(a))

import random
import math

a = random.uniform(0, 2 * math.pi)
b = random.uniform(0, 2 * math.pi)
c = random.uniform(0, 2 * math.pi)

radius = 40

p1 = (radius * math.cos(a), radius * math.sin(a))
p2 = (radius * math.cos(b), radius * math.sin(b))
p3 = (radius * math.cos(c), radius * math.sin(c))

print("Three random points generated on a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 40: ")
print(p1)
print(p2)
print(p3)

print("The angles between the three points are: ")
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
