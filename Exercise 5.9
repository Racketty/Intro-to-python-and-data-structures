#(Financial application: compute future tuition) Suppose that the tuition for a university is $10,000 this year and increases 5% every year. 
#In one year, the tuition will be $10,500. 
#Write a program that displays the tuition in 10 years and the total cost of four yearsâ€™ worth of tuition starting after the tenth year.

tuition = 10000
year = 0

while year <= 13:
    new = (tuition * 0.05)
    tuition += new
    year += 1
    if year == 10:
        print("Tuition in ten years is", tuition)
    if year > 10:
        total_cost = sum(tuition * (1 + 0.05) ** i for i in range(4))

print("The four-year total tuition in ten years is", total_cost)
