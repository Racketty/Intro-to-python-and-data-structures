#Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature.
#Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperatures of the water.
#The formula to compute the energy is as follows:
#Q = M * (finalTemperature - initialTemperature) * 4184
#where M is the weight of the water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules.

M = float(input("Enter the amount of water in kilograms: "))
initialTemperature = float(input("Enter the initial temperature: "))
finalTemperature = float(input("Enter the final temperature: "))

Q = M * (finalTemperature - initialTemperature) * 4184

print(Q)
